## üìú Project Abstract

This project provides a comprehensive operational analysis of **SPACE TREE Pvt. Ltd.**, a Gurgaon-based retail firm. Faced with significant inefficiencies, the company struggled with a critical **inventory paradox**: frequent stockouts of high-demand products coexisting with over ‚Çπ2.8L in excess slow-moving stock. This analysis uses sales, purchase, and inventory data from a six-month period to diagnose root causes‚Äîsuch as high supplier lead time variability and misalignment with market seasonality‚Äîand prescribes a data-driven framework to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve market responsiveness.

---

## üéØ Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this project as outlined in the initial proposal were:
* **Increase Market Demand:** To implement strategies that attract more customers and boost brand visibility.
* **Optimize Inventory Management:** To develop a data-driven approach to maintain optimal stock levels, reducing both waste and stockouts.
* **Improve Operational Efficiency:** To streamline processes using analytical tools, thereby lowering operational costs and improving decision-making.

---

## üî¨ Methodology Overview

The project followed a systematic five-phase analytical framework to move from raw data to actionable strategy:

**1. Data Collection & Preparation**
   * Sourced data from Sales, Purchase, and Stock Registers.
   * Cleaned and standardized the dataset using Microsoft Excel.

**2. Descriptive Analysis**
   * Summarized key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, sales volume, and inventory value.

**3. Diagnostic Analysis**
   * Employed **ABC Analysis** to classify products and **Root Cause Analysis** to identify problems like lead time variability.

**4. Predictive Analysis**
   * Used forecasting models (**EOQ & ROP**) in Excel and Python to determine optimal ordering policies.

**5. Prescriptive Analysis**
   * Translated insights into concrete business recommendations and simulated their financial impact.

## üí° Key Findings & Recommendations

The analysis yielded critical insights into the company's operations, leading to a set of targeted recommendations.

| üìä Key Findings                                                                                                                               | üöÄ Key Recommendations                                                                                                                 |

| **The Inventory Paradox:** Frequent stockouts on **18%** of high-demand items while holding **‚Çπ2.8L** in excess slow-moving inventory.          | **Implement Tiered ABC Analysis:** Prioritize inventory management efforts based on item value and velocity.                         |
| **High Lead Time Variability:** A standard deviation of **7.2 days** in supplier lead times, making reordering unpredictable.                  | **Adopt a Data-Driven Reordering System:** Use EOQ and a dynamic ROP model with safety stock to buffer against uncertainty.           |
| **Market Seasonality Misalignment:** Failure to align procurement with a predictable demand surge during Gurugram's peak construction season. | **Align Procurement with Seasonal Demand:** Proactively build stock before peak seasons and form partnerships with real estate firms. |
| **Reactive Operational Model:** Business decisions were driven by guesswork rather than data forecasting.                                     | **Drive Incremental Revenue:** Use sales data to create strategic product bundles and increase average transaction value.               |
